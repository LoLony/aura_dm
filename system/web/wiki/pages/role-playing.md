Role-Playing
=============================================================================

There are several role-playing quests that tell stories about different
characters or monsters, from the view-point of the respective creatures.
These typically take place in a dungeon, which you enter by dropping
special items on their altar. Afterwards, you're warped in, taking the
form of other characters.

### Giant Spider

Talk to Deian about his "Private Story" while having a *White Spider Fomor
Scroll*, a *Red Spider Fomor Scroll*, and a *Black Spider Fomor Scroll* in
your inventory. He will give you the *Giant Spider Fomor Scroll*.

Drop the scroll onto the Alby dungeon altar to enter the dungeon as a Spider.
After opening the boss door you will meet the Black Wizard, who transforms
you into a Giant Spider. Afterwards you receive the keyword "Birth of the
Giant Spider" and you're warped out of the dungeon.

Go back to Deian and talk to him about the new keyword, you'll receive a
**Shepherd's Gathering Knife** as reward.

### Trefor

Talk to Trefor during a part-time job for Deian or Tracy to get *Trefor's
Gauntlet* from him. Drop the item onto the Alby dungeon altar to enter the
dungeon as Trefor, in search for travelers who might need help.

There's only one room in the dungeon, where an NPC is surrounded by 6
Goblins that you have to kill to protect the NPC. if you fail to do so,
and the NPC is killed, the RP ends. Be careful with your attacks, since
you're able to hit the NPC.

If you fail, you can go back to Trefor to try again. You can do this as
many times as you want, but after the third fail you don't get a reward
anymore. The NPC gets stronger after the first fail though, making the RP
easier on repeated tries.

If you succeed, you get a **Wooden Blade** as reward.

### Chicken

Give Caitin a Golden Egg as a gift to receive the *Egg from Caitin*.
Drop this egg onto the Alby dungeon altar to play a chick on its search
for its mother.

### Ranald

Befriend Ranald by talking to him and giving him gifts until when you
talk to him about his "Private Story", he gives you the item *Ranald's
Medal*. Drop the item on the Rabbie dungeon altar to enter the dungeon
as Ranald.

The dungeon is a normal Rabbie, with a Succubuss at the end.
