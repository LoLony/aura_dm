     Seal Scroll in a campfire will increase the player's wound rate to
	 100% for approximately 60 seconds and effectively makes the player
	 invincible by reducing all damage taken to 1. Before attacking Glas
	 Ghaibhleann, it is recommended to collect a number of the scrolls
	 beforehand and distribute them to the party.
   - Since archers have a high wound rate percentage, it is possible to
     have one slowly break down Glas' HP with magnum shots or critical hits,
	 reducing the required amount of seal scrolls necessary to completely
	 finish off Glas.
   - It is possible to kill Glas with a high ranked windmill. Spawn the
     light gargoyles in the boss room, lure him into the smaller dungeon room,
	 then windmill away. It's recommended to have two people windmilling to
	 prevent Glas retaliating.
7. Defeat Glas Ghaibhleann and clear G1 mainstream scenario. The party leader
   will obtain the keyword "The Knight of Light". They will also acquire
   the title **who Saved the Goddess** and the enchant **Goddess**.
   - All party members will return to Tir Chonaill after the credit roll.

	 quit the game during the ending cut scene.
