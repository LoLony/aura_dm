This folder contains optional web server pages that aren't available by
default, such as a simple registration script. To enable those pages,
simply copy their folder to user/web/.

For example, if you want to make use of the registration page, copy the
folder "register" to user/web/. Afterwards you'll be able to access
it via your browser from http://***/register/ or
http://***/register/index.cs, where *** is the address of your web server.

For more information about how the web server works, check Aura's Wiki
at https://github.com/aura-project/aura/wiki/Web-server.
